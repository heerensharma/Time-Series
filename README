First encounter with pandas dataframe:

Step1: Realize the time data column

Step2: Convert it into the the datetime object

Step3: For advanced calculations, format the datetime as per desired precision

Step4: Now start grouping by the same datetime entries over desired criteria, e.g. mean of another column entry,
       nrow, etc. Keep "ddply" function of "plyr" R library in mind.
