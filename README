Words of wisdom:
1. Data may be evil. Like NA fields and even if you are doing the right things, world seem to fall apart.
2. Check the type of data types of columns before doing any conversion.

First encounter with pandas dataframe:

Step1: Realize the time data column

Step2: Convert it into the the datetime object

Step3: For advanced calculations, format the datetime as per desired precision

Step4: Now start grouping by the same datetime entries over desired criteria, e.g. mean of another column entry,
       nrow, etc. Keep "ddply" function of "plyr" R library in mind.
